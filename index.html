<h3>From my Fall 2020 research paper, covering the findings and work of my summer research group at the Yale University Gerstein Lab for Bioinformatics.</h3>
<p>ABSTRACT: Data from Hi-C techniques have revealed chromatin loops that bring together distant regulatory elements and make up topologically associating domains (TADs). Disrupting these enhancer-promoter contacts has been shown to result in transcriptional misregulation or whole-genome pathogenic phenotypes such as polydactyly, developmental disorders, or cancer. In this paper, we describe SupeRLoop, a supervised reinforcement learning-based algorithm to discover and visualize the policy of loop extrusion to understand the mechanisms behind loop formation. Initial results show the algorithm can predict loops with an accuracy of up to 80% in transcription factor-rich regions and that the CCTC-C binding factor (CTCF) plays a significant role as a boundary element in the process of loop formation.</p>

<h3>From the Spring 2019 review paper I wrote on chromatin structure and folding.</h3>
<p>ABSTRACT: Data from Hi-C techniques have revealed chromatin loops that bring together distant regulatory elements and make up topologically associating domains (TADs). Disrupting enhancer-promoter contacts or modifying the structure of chromatin so that activators and repressors become misplaced has been shown to result in transcriptional misregulation. The loop extrusion hypothesis emphasizes the role of cohesin and transcription factors in loop formation and has proved computationally sound when loops are disturbed. In this paper, we describe SupeRLoop, a supervised reinforcement learning-based algorithm to discover and visualize the policy of loop extrusion. Initial results show the algorithm can predict loops with an accuracy of up to 80% in TF-rich regions and that the CTCF binding motif plays a significant role as a boundary element in the process of loop formation.</p>
