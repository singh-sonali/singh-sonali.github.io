<h4>From my Fall 2020 research paper, covering the findings and work of my summer research group, mentored by Dr. Shaoke Lou, at the Yale University <a href="https://sites.gersteinlab.org/research/">Gerstein Lab for Bioinformatics.</a></h4>
<p>ABSTRACT: Data from Hi-C techniques have revealed chromatin loops that bring together distant regulatory elements and make up topologically associating domains (TADs). Disrupting these enhancer-promoter contacts has been shown to result in transcriptional misregulation or whole-genome pathogenic phenotypes such as polydactyly, developmental disorders, or cancer. In this paper, we describe SupeRLoop, a supervised reinforcement learning-based algorithm to discover and visualize the policy of loop extrusion to understand the mechanisms behind loop formation. Initial results show the algorithm can predict loops with an accuracy of up to 80% in transcription factor-rich regions and that the CCTC-C binding factor (CTCF) plays a significant role as a boundary element in the process of loop formation.</p>

<h4>From my Spring 2019 review paper on chromatin structure and folding.</h4>
<p>ABSTRACT: Understanding how the genome is folded into the highly ordered structure of chromatin that fits into the nucleus while retaining its functionality is an enduring question in biology. The introduction of chromosome conformation capture (3-C) technologies has provided insight into the structural organization of chromatin, but how this correlates to function is still being understood. This review summarizes the current knowledge about chromatin organization as well as recent visualization tools that have enabled further discovery into how chromatin structure regulates function. Topics covered include Hi-C, chromosome territories, TADs, loops, 2D visualization platforms, and 3D genome browsers.</p>
